Using Event Markers in RDV

SUMMARY
This feature allows a user of RDV to interact with the real-time data being
viewed. Event markers are a functionality by which moments in time can be
marked, annotated, and then later reviewed with all other historical data that
is present in DataTurbine.

DESIGN
- The event marker functionality is unpecedented in the reagrd that it makes RDV
into a DataTurbine source, meaning that it puts data into DataTurbine. Also 
without precedent is that this functionality makes RDV a collaboration tool. It
does this by creating a hiddeen source named "_Events*", where the * can be an 
underscore followed by any number. This is necessary to have multiple _Events
sources writing into DataTurbine at the same time which is necessary for
collaborative use. Each such source contains a channel called "EventsChannel"
that is populated with XML event markers.
- An element called "Event Marker Submission Panel" (EMSP) provides a trigger
with which a user can submit a new event marker and supply its label and textual
content.
- An element called "Event Marker Timeline" (EMT) has been added to the RDV
control panel. This element serves as the ui display of the internal workings of
the event marker functionality, which merges all the data from all event marker
sources, which are identified by a custom MIME type, "x-neesEvent".
The EMT then displays a scaled timeline of all event markers as small marks and
provides a user interface by which the labels of these marks can be displayed
and all other data that is present in DataTurbine at the point in time that the
mark is marking can be reviewed.
- A custom RDV data panel has been made specifically for event markers in order
to display custom views of their XML content. This can be used an can any RDV
data panel.

USAGE
- Overall Functionality
   The display of event marker functionality in the RDV interface can be toggled
using the "View -> Show Event Markers" menu selection. This controls the
visibility of the display of the EMT and of the EMSP when connected to a
DataTurbine server.
- Event Marker Data Panel
   There is a custom view of the XML that composes event markers that is
implemented as an RDV data panel. This allows real-time viewing of the textual
content of event markers as they occur. These can be activated in the RDV user
interface by double-clicking an event marker channel on the RDV Channel List
Panel or by using the menu selection "Window -> Add Event Marker Data Panel" to
create an empty data panel and then populating it with drag-n-drop.
- Event Marker Submission Panel
   This simple panel will become visible just above the RDV Status Panel. It
contains a single button to create an event marker. When event marker creation
is triggered a dialog asking to place RDV into real-time monitor mode is
generated if RDV is not in real-time monitor mode. The reason that this is
necessary is that RDV must know that the new event marker has been put into the
DataTurbine ring buffer inorder to provide feedback to the user that it has been
submitted. The time that teh creation button was clicked is recorded and a
dialog prompting the user to provide textual input for the label and content of
the event marker appears. Once the choice to submit the event marker is made,
the submission occurs with the time stamp that creation was triggered, and the
event markers timestamp in DataTurbine is set to this time.
- Event Marker Timeline
   This display serves an interface to jump back in time to a marked event of
interest. It creates a small black mark for every event marker in the
DataTurbine merged from all sources that generate event markers. It follows
first-in-last-out stack semantic in that a newly incident event marker will
appear on the far right of the timeline, shifting all other event markers left.
This timeline is scaled to the union of all event marker time intervals in the
DataTurbine ring buffer.
   A tool-tip will display the label with which an event marker was submitted
for the event marker nearest the mouse pointer when the mouse pointer is moved
over this timeline.
   Mouse-clicking on an event marker will move the time being viewed throughout
RDV to the point in time at which that event marker was timestamped.
