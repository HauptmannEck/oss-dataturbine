/**
 * This interface defines a data panel which is a component for getting
 * timestamped data from subscribed channels and displaying it in an optional UI
 * component. Implmentations of this interface are refered to as data panel
 * extensions.
 * <p>
 * The main application opens data panels and adds or removes channels to/from
 * them to control the data displayed. Client must not call the openPanel or
 * closePanel method as they are used by the application to manage the lifecycle
 * of this object.
 * <p>
 * The implementations of this interface must have a no argument constructor
 * that can be called to instantiate the data panel. Immediately after this
 * data panel has been instantiated, the openPanel method will be called. This
 * provides a reference to the DataPanelManager which is the callback to the
 * main application. The object is ready to use after this and the setChannel,
 * addChannel, and removeChannel methods may be called. Once the closePanel
 * method has been called the object may no longer be used and has reached the
 * end of its lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * The DataPanelManager gives access to two important components. The
 * RBNController which provides access to the time and data. The
 * DataPanelContainer which provides a container to dock UI components.
 * <p>
 * To register the data panel add an entry for it in the config/extensions.xml
 * configuration file.
