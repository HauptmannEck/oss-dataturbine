As of 11/02, I have gotten the driver to build and run on Mac OSX, v10.2.2.

Since I used the GNU getopt() function, you have to install it. I used Fink, which
puts it into an odd location, that's why the makefile is a bit odd for OSX builds.

Also note that I still don't completely grok OSX shared libraries, so I've rebuilt 
the flog messaging library to make a static library for OSX. Its a hack, but flog
is pretty small.
