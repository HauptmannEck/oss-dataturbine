.SH NAME
dbschema2xml \- Write a Datascope schema definition in XML syntax
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

dbschema2xml [schema]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbschema2xml\fP is a Java program that parses a Datascope schema definition
and outputs the same schema definition as an XML application.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "schema"
The filename containing the Datascope schema definition.  Note that this 
program isn't yet smart enough to search the schema search path, so you
have to provide a full filename.
.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
The format of the output is described by ds-schema.dtd, which is currently
filed away in the source directory of dbxml.  This DTD should be considered 'alpha' 
and subject to change.

The Datascope schema is parsed using a new parser implemented in Java, so it's
possible that it recognizes a slightly different syntax.

You need to have Java installed and working.

The program should be able to search for schemas in the usual way.
