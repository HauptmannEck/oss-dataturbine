2004-06-02 14:55  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb, daq-testing.llb: Update NSDS simulator to
	correctly plot all streamed channels. Also fixed error handling in
	streaming data daemon.

2004-06-02 12:44  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb: Update streaming data daemon to
	asynchronously update the status LEDs. Been meaning to do that.

2004-06-02 12:10  hubbard

	* MOST-programs.llb, Subroutines.llb, daq-examples.llb,
	mini-most-two.llb, mini-most.llb, ntcp-examples.llb,

	sw_subVIs/1D Straight Line Move-Start BC.vi, sw_subVIs/Move
	Constraints-Counts Steps.vi: Naru - changes in control point
	placement on M2 required small fixes.

2004-05-25 18:25  hubbard

	* mini-most-two.llb, ntcp-testing.llb: Correct logic on getCP code
	in M2 control, change default CP name in NTCP simulator program.

2004-05-25 18:21  hubbard

	message in M2 control.

2004-05-25 16:28  hubbard

	* MOST-programs.llb, Subroutines.llb, daemon-programs.llb,
	daq-examples.llb, mini-most-two.llb, mini-most.llb,
	ntcp-examples.llb, ntcp-subroutines.llb, queuing-code.llb: A couple
	more small fixes, in the dual-axis NTCP simulator and M2 control
	program. Also recompiled all code to check for other errors.

2004-05-25 10:45  hubbard

	* MOST-programs.llb, Subroutines.llb, daemon-programs.llb,
	daq-examples.llb, make-dist, mdist.conf, mini-most-two.llb,
	mini-most.llb, ntcp-examples.llb, ntcp-subroutines.llb,
	ntcp-testing.llb, queuing-code.llb: Lots of changes: New M2
	(mini-most-2) code, a small bit of reorg.  M2 code needs regression
	testing this week, so further changes are possible.

2004-05-12 11:30  hubbard

	* mini-most-two.llb: Added code for DAQ getControlPoint, should
	work. Still not tested.

2004-05-11 16:08  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb.llb: Wrong filename, duplicate code, removed.

2004-05-11 16:07  hubbard

	* daq-examples.llb, mini-most-two.llb: Code update - first pass at
	M2 control code ready to test.

	dual-axis mini-most.

2004-05-07 15:41  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, daq-examples.llb, daq-testing.llb,
	ntcp-examples.llb, ntcp-subroutines.llb: Work in progress - new
	code for Mini-MOST-2. Also added NTCP-triggered DAQ test code.

2004-03-18 15:36  hubbard

	* ChangeLog: Auto-generated by cvs2cl.pl, nice to have.

2004-03-01 17:37  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, daq-examples.llb, ntcp-examples.llb,
	ntcp-subroutines.llb: Lots of new code for the RPI demo - Mini-most
	and other codes unaffected. Now have ADXL code, examples and
	subroutines, and a new DAQ for Anco that reads NI-DAQ and ADXL as
	well. 4-axis accelerometer, plus trimmings.

2004-03-01 15:41  cphillip

	* make-dist, mdist.conf:   o Bump to version 2.2.

2004-02-27 14:53  hubbard

	* ntcp-examples.llb, ntcp-testing.llb: New code - control of shake
	table via NTCP, runs a stored earthquake when execute command
	arrives. Mini-most code unchanged!
	
	Also increased the read timeout in 'ntcp exerciser' to 90 seconds,
	as the quake file is 60 seconds long.

2004-02-23 16:14  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb: Library had doubled extension; this commit
	corrects its name. Code unchanged.

2004-02-20 10:17  cphillip

	* make-dist, mdist.conf:   o Bump to 2.2rc3.

2004-02-20 10:07  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb.llb, mini-most.llb: Bugfix - metadata and
	data file header did not include load cell channel ID and units.
	Mini-most specific.

2004-02-20 09:55  cphillip

	* make-dist, mdist.conf:   o Change compression format to zip.

2004-02-19 20:58  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb.llb, mini-most.llb, ntcp-testing.llb: Bugfix
	- NTCP control daemon does not destroy DAQ semaphore on plugin
	reconnect. Caused DAQ failures when running more than one NTCP
	connection per control daemon run. Tested on UIUC mini-most.

2004-02-19 17:28  cphillip

	* make-dist, mdist.conf:   o Bump to version 2.2rc2

2004-02-19 14:18  hubbard

2004-02-18 15:27  hubbard

	ntcp-subroutines.llb: Bugfixes - Load cell delay at control
	startup, load cell delay subroutine, new semaphore for DAQ hardware
	access, several associated subroutines. Also, the DAQ now filters
	reads on the load cell, this required several new subroutines to
	handle.

2004-02-18 09:56  cphillip

	* make-dist, mdist.conf:   o Bump to version 2.2a3.

2004-02-17 18:36  hubbard

	* MOST-programs.llb, mini-most.llb, ntcp-subroutines.llb: Open loop
	motor control, tested perfect out to 500 steps. Looking much
	better.

2004-02-17 15:46  hubbard

	* MOST-programs.llb, mini-most.llb, ntcp-subroutines.llb: Updated a
	bit - mini-most control program now filters all load cell readings,
	added filter test program to mini-most archive, still working on
	the PID code.

2004-02-17 10:12  cphillip

	* make-dist, mdist.conf:   o Bump version number to 2.2a2.

2004-02-16 21:35  hubbard

	continues.

2004-02-10 14:57  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, daq-testing.llb: Same as last, missed one
	subroutine.

2004-02-10 14:49  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, daq-testing.llb: Modified Fake DAQ to run
	without NI-DAQ present by skipping read of channel units. This now
	fakes the units as all-voltage, and should run on non-Windows
	Labview sysems.

2004-02-06 10:39  hubbard

	* MOST-SIM.llb, nees-progs.llb, lv-ntcp.llb, motion-control.llb:

	more ntcp+nsds testing runs. Looking good.

2004-02-04 17:41  hubbard

	* daemon-programs.llb.llb, mini-most.llb: Move control daemon from
	mini-most library, update copy in daemon-programs. There can be
	only one.

2004-02-04 11:41  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, daq-testing.llb: Bugfix - unable to run NSDS and
	NTCP due to a non-reentrant subroutine in my TCP code. Passes
	initial tests OK.

2004-02-04 11:32  hubbard

	* ntcp-subroutines.llb, ntcp-testing.llb: Work in progress.

2004-02-04 11:20  hubbard

	there's a more consistent organization.

2003-12-12 08:04  hubbard

	* mini-most.llb: Changed default settling time to 3 seconds, test
	in progress. DAQ default changed to no ftp.

2003-10-07 09:38  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, lv-ntcp.llb, motion-control.llb,

	stop polling, less CPU usage, code cleanup. Tests OK.

2003-07-21 10:13  hubbard

	* MOST-SIM.llb, nees-progs.llb: Now deletes datum files after the

	corresponding .written file at the same time.

2003-07-18 16:33  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb: Bugfix, courtesy of Jose's test code - two
	repeated bad commands would disconnect the driver. Oops. Fixed.

	* nees-progs.llb: Bugfixes to DAQ programs (Example DAQ, Simplest,
	Semi-Fake) where the metadata file was not saved unless the 'save
	to disk' was set. This caused problems with streaming, due to
	outdated channel lists being sent out from old metadata. Kudos to
	Liang Chen at UIUC.

2003-04-29 17:24  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb: [no log message]

	repository for definition.

2002-11-05 17:10  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb: Small bugfix - server daemon
	restarts connection if the streaming data connection gets an error.

2002-11-01 16:07  hubbard

2002-10-30 17:24  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb: OK, new streaming/queue code

	but not repeatable, most worrysome.

2002-10-30 16:58  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb, queuing-code.llb: Well, new
	queueing code is a bust - no faster and utterly ruins the CPU.
	Sigh. Saved into a separate library, back to the grindstone now to
	remove it after this commit.

2002-10-30 16:14  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb: Big merge - new TCP queueing
	code, revised the server daemon, much to do yet!

2002-10-28 17:34  hubbard

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb:

	* Subroutines.llb, nees-progs.llb: 
	Broken into two libraries now for ease of use, adding routines for
	metadata downloads, working on channel calibrations as well.
