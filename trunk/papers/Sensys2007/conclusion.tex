\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

%Streaming data systems occupy a middle ground between simple communications and transactional systems. 

Environmental science and engineering communities are now actively engaged in the early planning and development phases of the next generation of large-scale sensor-based observing systems.  In all of these systems, streaming data has a central role. The RBNB DataTurbine, recently open-sourced, presents a compelling solution by addressing a core set of cyberinfrastructure requirements common across several environmental observing systems initiatives. 
% with reduced complexity. 
Our deployments to date show that the RBNB DataTurbine middleware provides a modular, scalable, and robust solution and we are pleased with its results.

%Environmental science and engineering communities are now actively engaged in the early planning and development phases of the next generation of large-scale sensor-based observing systems.  All of these systems  require streaming data middleware.  To that end, in this paper we described how the open-source RBNB DataTurbine streaming data middleware system satisfies a core set of critical infrastructure requirements common across several environmental observing systems initiatives, including reliable data transport, the promotion of sensors and sensor streams to first-class objects, a framework for the integration of heterogeneous instruments, and a comprehensive suite of services for data management, routing, synchronization, monitoring, and visualization. We also presented the results from real-world deployments. Overall in these deployments, we found that the RBNB DataTurbine middleware  streaming data provides a robust platform for observing systems.
