<span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure for Deploying a Sensor
Array, DataLogger, and
DataTurbine Middleware</span><br>
Lawrence J. Miller, Senior Developer, UC San Diego<br>
Paul F. Hubbard, Senior Developer, UC San Diego<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span><br>
This document is intended to explain how to deploy a streaming data
system based on RBNB DataTurbine and software from CLEOS. The focus is
on the field station end, i.e. sensors, datalogger and local server.<br>
Upon successful completion, real-time data streams from an array of
sensors into a DataTurbine ring buffer will be established.<br>
Examples from a deployment that was completed at the Santa Margarita
Ecological Reserve by CLEOS are in the examples section at the end of
this document.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Prerequisites</span><br>
1. Power - there will have to be an infrastructure to provide power to
the datalogger and to sensors in the field. Also consider power
conditioning (transients such as lightning) and possibly battery backup
power such as UPS, depending on site conditions and reliability
requirements.<br>
2. Local communications link - the datalogger must be able to
communicate with DataTurbine server&nbsp; the via some digital
communications interface, such as 802 ethernet, 80211 wirekless,&nbsp;
or RS-232 serial. <br>
3. Adaptations to physical environment - this aspect is the most
situation-specific. The only point that can be said to be generally
true is that sensitive electronics like the PoP computer system and the
datalogger will need to be protected from environmental exposure.
Sensors will have requirements on their positioning that may require
physical adaptation.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Materials</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here are the materials required to reproduce the
deployment. The following categories will be common to most deployments:<br>
1. Sensors - ensure that power requirements are feasible and that the
communications interface is supported by the datalogger. Examples of
common communications interfaces are TCP/IP, RS-232, and SDI-12.<br>
2. Datalogger - a device that can acquire data from the chosen sensors
and then forward this data stream to the PoP server via a digital
communications interface, such as RS-232 or TCP/IP.<br>
3. Environmental adaptation - construction required to adequately
secure deployed equipment from any possible environmental detriment.
Common examples of environmental adaptations are outdoor enclosures for
electronic equipment and rugged mounting to poles and masts.<br>
4. Hardware and wiring - it is important that such materials are
planned for before going into the field. Furthermore, construct as much
of the deployment as possible on the bench.<br>
5. Point of Presence (PoP) computer system - variants of the UNIX
operating system are recommended. In general, the more memory the
better and adequate disk to accommodate at least twice the expected
quantity of data to be stored in the DataTurbine ring buffer. Note that
it is often better to place the computer physically separate from the
datalogger, preferably indoors, as few machines are designed for the
environmental extremes that exist in an enclosure.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PoP Software Requirements</span><br>
DataTurbine and its applications are Java programs and run on any
operating system with a Java virtual machine (JVM). They&#8217;ve been tested
on Microsoft Windows, Linux, OSX, and Solaris.<br>
<br>
The POP node also should have<br>
1. Software that enables remote login (SSH, RDC, VNC,&nbsp; Citrix, etc)<br>
2. Java virtual machine in which to run DataTurbine and applications<br>
3. Latest DataTurbine. See this link for installation instructions:
http://dataturbine.org/content/how-deploy-rbnb<br>
4. DataTurbine source program specific to the communication protocol of
the datalogger being used.<br>
5. Environment variables:<br>
a. Set Java CLASSPATH to include RBNB_HOME/bin/rbnb.jar<br>
b. Set&nbsp; RBNB_HOME to have the value of the DataTurbine
installation root. <br>
c. Add the entry $RBNB_HOME/bin/rbnb.jar to the Java CLASSPATH in any
environments in which DataTurbine and related DAQ programs are to be
used.<br>
6. Configuring the PoP hardware:<br>
a. Auto-start when powered up, so that if site power is interrupted it
will boot without human intervention<br>
7. DataTurbine Source Program(s) for data acquisition (DAQ)<br>
<br>
Bench-test operational validation of integrated system<br>
The motivation for this section is to try the integrated system at the
bench. &#8220;Test what you fly, and fly what you test,&#8221; as NASA puts it.<br>
<br>
1. Assembly - assemble all components as completely and as
representative of the actual field deployment as possible<br>
2. Configure a PoP as specified above<br>
3. Have all networking between the datalogger and the PoP and the PoP
and clients routed over the Wide-Area Network (WAN) in order to
represent deployment operation. If that&#8217;s not possible, consider
simulating WAN conditions with a bench-deployed network simulator such
as http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Netem<br>
4. Verify end-to-end data flow over the network and troubleshoot, as
appropriate, at each step:<br>
a. Sensors -&gt; cRIO -&gt; DataTurbine -&gt; DataTurbine client
application program<br>
<br>
The system is operationally validated by this end-to-end data flow<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation qualification</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The purpose of this step is to verify that
installation results in a system that is functional enough to be
operated remotely.<br>
1. Physically mount enclosure - ensure that all fittings are secure and
that the equipment is solidly attached.<br>
2. Weatherproof - ensure that there are no external air spaces and that
all bulkheads (e.g. the screw pressure cable fittings) are tight.<br>
3. Mount sensors<br>
4. Plug in to power and network - verify that the datalogger powers up
and can be reached on the network by using the ping or traceroute
programs, for example. Also validate that whatever TCP ports you&#8217;re
using are up and working, e.g. &#8216;telnet datalogger {port}&#8217;<br>
5. Secure the enclosure with a lock and give a key to the site engineer<br>
6. Setup PoP in machine room - connect to power and network<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Operational qualification</span><br>
The purpose of this step to verify that the integrated and installed
system functions to stream real-time data from end to end and that the
system is maintainable.<br>
1. Verify that all network components can communicate on the local area
network. <br>
2. Verify that all network components are reachable from the wide-area
network.<br>
3. Verify that remote software interaction with the PoP function
properly<br>
<br>
The deployment is qualified for operation if the real-time data stream
can be accessed by a DataTurbine client from a host system on the
wide-area network and its possible to administer the system remotely.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance Qualification</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Verify that the system will perform as required for
the expected operating environment. Some examples of this could be:<br>
1. "sanity checking" of data streams - verify that the data values make
sense in order to validate proper functioning of the sensors and
datalogger<br>
2. Loss of communications - verify that the system can recover from
interruptions in its internal communications via remote interaction
once communications are restored.<br>
3. Loss of power - verify that the system can recover from
interruptions in power supply via remote interaction,once power is
restored.<br>

&nbsp;- 8m outdoor extension cord was used to route line power into the
enclosure. 3 cables, power, network (8m cat5), and M12, were routed
into the enclosure through 3/4" holes drilled in the bottom of the
enclosure that had screw pressure fittings<br>
- 1.5" U-bolts were extremely useful for mounting both the enclosure
and the WXT510 to the mounting post.<br>
