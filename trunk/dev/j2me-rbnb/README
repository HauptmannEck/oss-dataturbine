What this is
============

This is the port of RBNB DataTurbine to Java 2 Mobile Edition. Work was done by
Brian Ryujin for Sameer Tilak of the CLEOS center at UCSD/SDSC.

More information on DataTurbine can be found at http://dataturbine.org/

Notes
=====

At present there is no documentation for this project. The idea was to produce native
Java code for DataTurbine that'd run on Nokia cell phones, to serve as an always-
connected inexpensive datalogger and display device.
