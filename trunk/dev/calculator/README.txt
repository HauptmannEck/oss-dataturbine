This directory tree is for building an expression parser and evaluator.Normally, this this is not necessary. To use the existing parser,add the jar file ./lib/calculator.jar to your class path and use themethods of org.nees.calculate.expression.Expression, to create andevaluate a parse tree for expressions.See the demo program, Demo.java, for an example.Further documentation is at ./doc/index.htmlThe contents of directory:    README.txt - this file    README.html - an html version of this file    lib - the jar file needed by the package, and the jar file        generated by the package        javacc.jar - javacc 3.2 the java compiler compiler        JacaCC.zip - a copy of javacc.jar (it is needed in            this form my ant 1.5 - see javacc and jjtree tags            in the ant file        calculate.jar - the jar file generated by this package            put this on your classpath to use the parsing            and evaluation methods of the Expression class            (see further documentation in ./doc/indec.html    src - the source files for the parser and test programs    doc - the documentation for this package    Demo.java - a stand alone demo to exercise the parser
